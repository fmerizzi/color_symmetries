# color_symmetries
In this repo I explore some techniques for producing color sets by exploiting symmetries in color representation. 
Some of the functions are made with RGB color schemes, some others are obtained with HLS degrees symmetries.

__new update__
its possible now to export the color palette in a GPL file, such that it can be easily used in painting programs.
